### Sustainable financing instruments

The Climate Action Finance Framework (CAFF) remains CLP’s main channel for sustainable financing. The framework stipulates ways in which the Group’s businesses can raise financing including bonds and loans to address climate change challenges. In April, CAPCO executed a two-year offshore RMB300 million (HK$339 million) fixed rate private placement bond under CAFF and swapped the proceeds to Hong Kong dollars to refinance some existing bank loans. The bond was completed with preferential financing terms and was the first offshore RMB bond issuance for a CLP business, enabling further diversification in the Group’s financing.

In May and June, CAPCO executed HK$1.3 billion of one-year and two-year energy transition bank loan facilities in line with CAFF to refinance existing loans.

Both CLP Power and CAPCO have Medium Term Note programmes in place under which bonds in aggregate amounts of up to US$4.5 billion and US$2 billion respectively can be issued. As of 31 December, notes with aggregate nominal values of around HK$24.4 billion and HK$9.5 billion were issued by CLP Power and CAPCO respectively.

Around 62% of financing arranged by CLP’s SoC businesses in 2023 was through sustainable financing compared with 68% the previous year. CLP Power and CAPCO had HK$32.2 billion of outstanding sustainable financing at the end of the year including HK$19 billion of CAFF financing, as well as HK$13.2 billion of emission reduction-linked facilities with 14 banks.

CLP China executed a RMB293 million (HK$316 million) onshore non-recourse project loan facility for a solar energy project at a competitive interest rate. The business also lowered the interest rates of non-recourse project loans for three renewable energy projects totalling RMB718 million (HK$774 million).

EnergyAustralia executed a A$630 million (HK$3.3 billion) three-year loan facility with nine banks on competitive terms to refinance an existing facility. In addition, the business extended the tenor of a bank guarantee facility of A$150 million (HK$798 million) by one year to December 2024.

CLP’s fixed-rate debt as a proportion of total debt at the end of December was 57% (2022: 52%), excluding perpetual capital securities or 60% (2022: 55%) including perpetual capital securities.

### Navigating geopolitical instability

CLP’s prudent financing strategies, underpinned by robust governance and risk management, helped strengthen its capital resources to support the Group’s ongoing decarbonisation despite continuing market volatility. This approach was reflected in the pre-emptive action to complete major financing activities with preferential terms at the end of 2022 and early 2023, as well as the Group’s efforts to further diversify financing in terms of capital sources, currencies, debt tenor and instruments.

The Group maintained a high level of interest rate and foreign currency hedging at commercially acceptable terms to cover committed and highly probable financial obligations, enabling it to withstand financial market volatility and pursue its business objectives. This included the use of natural hedge and approved financial derivative instruments with straightforward, easy-to-understand features that can qualify for effective accounting hedge with no adverse profit- and-loss impact to manage obligations and risks.

For counterparty exposure, CLP transacts only with credible financial institutions and financially sound business counterparts with strong credit ratings. These measures help ensure CLP’s businesses do not face undue residual financial or credit risks and give strong grounds for confidence to stakeholders.

### Acting as a trusted partner in the energy transition

CLP continued to engage capital providers on the Group’s efforts on decarbonisation. The Asia Investor Group on Climate Change’s Asian Utilities Engagement Program recognised the Group’s decarbonisation efforts including the commitment to exit coal-fired generation before 2040 and the use of battery storage technology.

During COP28, organisations including the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) and the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Markets (IC-VCM) agreed to increase collaboration on standards for carbon credits and enhance transparency and consistency for the instruments. CLP will consider the use of credible carbon offsets as a last resort to offset emissions in its value chain as the Group remains focused on reducing direct emissions from its operations by transitioning to lower-carbon technologies. CLP supports the efforts of the VCMI and IC-VCM to improve the integrity of voluntary carbon markets. The Group is currently undertaking a review on its carbon market strategy covering a range of factors including market trading opportunities and carbon credit generation from CLP’s assets. The review is expected to be completed this year.

EnergyAustralia’s Tallawarra B Power Station in New South Wales, which officially opened in February 2024, is Australia’s first net-zero emissions gas-fired power station with 100% of direct carbon emissions offset over its operational life. As part of funding arrangements to proceed with the construction of Tallawarra B in 2021, EnergyAustralia will purchase credible carbon offsets for all emissions from the plant.
