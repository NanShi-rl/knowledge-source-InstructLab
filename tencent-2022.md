### BOARD OF DIRECTORS

##### Responsibilities

The Board’s fundamental responsibility is to exercise its best judgment and to act in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board oversees management’s efforts to promote the Company’s success while operating in an effective and responsible manner. The Board also formulates the Company’s overall business strategy and monitors management’s execution of such strategy.

The Board has defined the business and governance issues for which it needs to be responsible, and these matters are reviewed periodically to ensure that the Company maintains effective and up-to-date corporate governance practices. In this regard, the Board:
- determines the Group’s mission, provides its strategic direction and is responsible for the approval of strategic plans;
- approves the annual business plan and budget proposed by management;
- retains full and effective control over the Group and monitors management with regard to the implementation of the approved annual business plan and budget;

The Board delegates the responsibility of day-to-day business and operations to the Company’s senior management team, which includes its chief officers, the president and executive vice-presidents. The senior management team meets once every two weeks or as frequently as necessary to formulate policies and make recommendations to the Board. The senior management team administers, enforces, interprets and supervises compliance with the internal rules and operational procedures of the Company as well as its subsidiaries and conducts regular reviews, recommends and advises on appropriate amendments to such rules and procedures. The senior management team reports to the Board on a regular basis and communicates with the Board whenever required.

To better serve the long-term interests of our stakeholders, the Board delegates certain matters requiring particular time, attention and expertise to its committees. The Board has determined that these matters are better dealt with by the committees as they require independent oversight and specialist input. As such, the Board has established five committees to assist the Board: Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee. Each of the committees has its terms of reference which clearly specifies its powers and authorities. All committees report back to the Board and make recommendations to the Board if necessary.

----------

Under the supervision and guidance of the Board, the Company has adopted a risk management and internal control  structure, referred to as the “Three Lines of Defence” model, to ensure the effectiveness of its risk management and internal control systems.

#### First Line of Defence – Operation and Management

Our First Line of Defence is mainly comprised of business and functional departments of each business group of the Company who are responsible for the day-to-day operation and management. They are responsible for designing and implementing controls to address the risks.

#### Second Line of Defence – Risk Management

Our Second Line of Defence is mainly the IC. They are responsible for formulating policies related to the risk management and internal control of the Company and for planning and implementing the establishment of integrated risk control systems. To ensure the effective implementation of such systems, they also assist and supervise the first line of defence in the establishment and improvement of risk management and internal control systems.

#### Third Line of Defence – Independent Assurance

Our Third Line of Defence is comprised of the IA and the Anti-fraud Investigation Department.

The IA holds a high degree of independence and is responsible for providing independent evaluation and verification on the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems, and monitoring the management’s improvement and enhancement on risk management and internal controls.

The Company has formulated policies and established management systems to enhance and support the Company’s compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations. The Anti-fraud Investigation Department is responsible for receiving whistleblower reports through various channels and following up and investigating alleged fraudulent activities. It also assists management in promoting the “Tencent Sunshine Code of Conduct” (the “Sunshine Code”) and the value of integrity to all 
employees of the Company.

The IA and the Anti-fraud Investigation Department have direct reporting lines to the Audit Committee.

The Three Lines of Defence model of the risk management and internal control systems are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failing to implement the business strategy of the Company, and can only provide reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

The Board and management have always prioritised the maintenance and establishment of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems. In 2022, the Company has consistently improved the risk management and internal control systems, and has also continuously increased the awareness of risk management among the employees. The internal control function continues to get involved early in the front line of the business and proactively support the business groups in identifying and managing the risks and enhancing risk management and internal controls in a more comprehensive and timely manner, to ensure the healthy development of business. The IA continues to carry out independent audit over various key businesses and management areas, and improves digital audit capability to effectively identify risks and provide effective and timely evaluations. The Anti-fraud Investigation Department further advocates the value of integrity among the employees, actively follows up and investigates the alleged fraudulent activities. The connection and interaction among the three lines of defence have been further enhanced to provide more effective support to the Company’s development.

### Risk Management

The Company is committed to continuously improving its risk management system, including its structure, process, and culture. By enhancing the Company’s risk management capabilities, it ensures the healthy and sustainable development of the Company’s business.

The Company has established a risk management system (including the “Three Lines of Defence” model as detailed above) which sets out the roles and responsibilities of each relevant party in the system as well as the relevant risk management policies and processes. Each business group of the Company, on a regular basis, identifies and assesses any risks that may negatively impact the achievement of its objectives, and formulates appropriate response measures. The Company also provides risk management and internal control training for staff on a regular basis.

#### Risk Management Process

Being an Internet and technology company with a wide variety of rapidly-changing businesses, the Company has adopted the following dynamic risk management process in response to the ever-changing risk landscape:
- Business and functional departments of each business group identify, assess and respond to risks in the course of operation in a systematic manner;
- Through collecting, consolidating and analysing the Company’s businesses, the IC builds a list of significant risks at both the corporate and business level, and ensures that appropriate risk response strategies and control measures have been taken for such risks. These significant risks as well as the corresponding risk responses and control measures will be reviewed by management and subsequently by the Audit Committee before reporting to the Board;
- The IC analyses and evaluates the responses to significant risks from time to time, and reports to the Audit Committee at least once a year; and
- The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, assesses and determines the nature and level of the risks that the Company is willing to take in order to achieve its business objectives and formulates appropriate response strategies which include designating responsible departments for handling each significant risk. The Audit Committee provides guidance to the Company’s management to implement effective risk management system with support from the IC.

### Significant Risks of the Company

The complexity of the Company’s business continues to increase and the external environment continues to evolve. Facing a wide range of significant risks, including but not limited to ESG risk, and through risk management analysis and evaluation, management considers that the ten significant risks disclosed in the financial year 2021 still exist, in which the “Market competition and innovation risk” has increased to a certain extent while the other risks remain at a similar risk level as last
year.

On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee supervises the overall risk management of the Company and assesses the change in the nature and severity of the Company’s significant risks. The Audit Committee considers that management has taken appropriate measures to address and manage the significant risks that they are responsible for at a level acceptable to the Board.

Below is a summary of the significant risks of the Company along with the applicable response strategies. The Company’s risk profile may change and the list below is not intended to be exhaustive.

#### 1. Regulatory and compliance risk

The global regulations and laws relating to the Internet and technology industry have become clearer. As the Company continuously expands its businesses domestically and globally, the Company must abide by and comply with the relevant applicable laws and regulations in different countries and jurisdictions, including but not limited to laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection, anti-trust, anti-unfair competition, IP, telecommunications and Internet, gaming, Internet finance, labour protection, foreign investment, international trade, etc. In addition, changes in international circumstances may affect the development of global policies and regulations and impact the development of various industries across different regions.

The Company has taken practical steps to devote substantial resources in various areas to ensure the Company’s compliance with regulatory requirements. The Company has set up dedicated compliance departments and compliance specialist teams, engaged external professional consultants to communicate with relevant regulatory authorities in a timely manner, kept abreast of the changes to relevant laws and regulations, adjusted strategies accordingly, taken appropriate actions or measures, improved internal training and the understanding of the laws and regulations, and enhanced the corresponding management system to ensure that the Company is in compliance with such applicable laws and regulations.

#### 2. Market competition and innovation risk

The Internet and technology industries are highly competitive with rapid product updates and replacements, and competition of AI-related technology also draws a lot of attention. The development of technologies brings evolutional changes to the existing business models and brings in more new players into the market. The existing market
competition landscape may face major changes. Therefore, how to promote innovative and sustainable social values through innovation in technology, product and business model are the key challenges of the Company.

The Company attaches great importance to innovation and stays on top of the developments of the industry and user needs, keeps up with the technological development through innovation in frontier technology, and constantly improves the Company’s products and services. It also explores the application scenarios of emerging technologies and brings additional values and experiences to its users and business partners. The Company enhances its innovation capabilities by constantly optimising its organisational structure, attracting and nurturing more talents, and increasing its investments in more research and development. The Company also continuously optimises its resource allocation, enhances its core business products, strengthens its product development and technical capabilities, explores innovative business models, develops products that meet the expectations of both domestic and international markets, continuously improves user experience, promotes sustainable development of its businesses and increases its market competitiveness. The Company collaborates with its partners to jointly innovate, enhance service capabilities, and support the ecosystem in order to achieve product service growth and continuous iterative innovation, and create value for users and the society.

#### 3. Macroeconomic risk

The Company’s revenue generated from certain businesses is closely related to the macro-economic circumstances and the overall consumption economy. As the Company continues to expand its international businesses, factors such as the ever-changing international circumstances, the difference in the speed of economic development across regions, emergencies such as epidemic may reduce individual users’ purchasing power and their willingness to consume, impacting the operation and profits of our corporate clients, and thereby leading to a reduction in the resources they invest in market and business development, which may in turn adversely affect certain revenue streams of the Company. Recently, despite the uncertainties resulting from the domestic economic circumstances and the easing of epidemic,
they may still lead to changes in trading and investment policies and markets, which may negatively impact on the Company’s operations and collaborations with its business partners, and in turn affect and weaken the Company’s competitiveness and growth potential.

Based on the change in macroeconomic environment, the Company adjusts its business development strategy in a scientific, flexible, and reasonable manner to address the risks posed by the macroeconomic risks, and continuously seeks opportunities for business growth. The Company attaches great importance to product innovation, upholds the business philosophy of focusing on user value, continuously improves user experience, and builds long-term and stable relationships with its existing customers to achieve sustainable business growth. Meanwhile, the Company will continue to uphold its mission and vision of “Value for Users, Tech for Good” to provide innovative product solutions and digital services to assist its clients and business partners in further enhancing their competitiveness and productivity to achieve sustainable growth, and to also create value for its customers and business partners, and fulfill its social responsibility.

#### 4. Information security risk

All countries and jurisdictions continue to heighten the regulatory enforcement over cyber security and personal data protection. The security of personal user and corporate client data is the top priority of the Company. The Company continues to pay attention to the laws and policies relating to user privacy and data security in various jurisdictions and is fully aware that any loss or leakage of such information could have a significant negative impact on the affected users and clients, which could expose the Company to significant legal liability and significant reputational risk. 

The Company strongly believes that the security of user data and privacy is the key prerequisite for delivering secured and high-quality products and user experience. The Company strictly complies with relevant laws and regulations, continuously invests resources in strengthening information security management. The Company classified user and client data as the Company’s most sensitive information. It has also established and will continue to enhance the policies and management measures to ensure the security of such information and data, including but not limited to establishing effective information management systems, with the use of encryption, data access restrictions and controls, and the establishment of rigorous approval processes. In addition, the Company has established a specialised team to conduct independent regular reviews over the management of the business groups’ sensitive information and data, and provide trainings on information security to raise the awareness of information security amongst its staff. The Company upholds the mission and vision of “Value for Users, Tech for Good” and constantly improves the infrastructure of its network and
data security.

#### 5. Crisis management, public relations and reputational risk

As an Internet and technology company, the Company has a diverse portfolio of businesses and products with increasingly complicated business models, and an extensive network of users and business partners, which draws attention from the public and media to the Company’s brand. The Company needs to fully consider possible crisis that may occur in its domestic and international business operations, and actively responds to them to avoid further deepening of issues or escalation of crisis. The Company also needs to timely disclose comprehensive and accurate information to the public. Otherwise, it may damage the Company’s reputation, brand and image, and may adversely affect the business and prospects of the Company.

The Company treasures its brand and reputation. In adherence to the principles of openness and transparency, the Company communicates to the public comprehensive and accurate information in a timely manner. In response to crisis, the Company has established a corresponding response mechanism, to follow up on the development of crisis, conduct risk assessment, and make prompt decisions in a timely manner, to reduce the impact of the crisis on the Company. The Company has also set up professional public relations department and teams to establish and continuously enhance its crisis management mechanism, to provide trainings and guidance related to crisis management, to continuously improve its crisis response capabilities, and to reduce the possibility of crisis. The public relations team maintains close contact with the Company’s management and business teams, pays close attention to and gathers public opinions, analyses relevant information in a timely manner and reports to management to enable management to respond promptly and effectively in accordance with the Company’s policies and procedures and disclose comprehensive and accurate information to the public in a timely manner and to continuously protect the Company’s reputation.

#### 6. M&A and investment management risk

The Company has a diversified investment portfolio. The complex and ever-changing international relations and heightened domestic and foreign regulatory policies have imposed higher requirements over the formulation of investment strategies, fund management, pre-investment evaluation and post-investment management. Failure to timely and effectively manage investment risks could hinder the realisation of investment strategies and lead to probable financial loss of the Company.

The Company pays a lot of attention to investment risk and has established an Investment Committee under the Board. The Company also puts in place an investment evaluation and approval process, and sets up a dedicated professional team to advise on investment projects. Finance, legal and other relevant professional teams are responsible for managing relevant investment risks and following up with post-investment management, reviewing the operating and financial information of the investee companies on a regular basis, monitoring and analysing the performance of the investee companies, to ensure that they continue to meet the Company’s investment strategies. The Company will continuously monitor the trend of the macroeconomic environment and the changes in the laws and regulations of various industries, conduct dynamic analysis and develop strategy for risk management to effectively manage the investment risks.

#### 7. ToB business risk

The Company has actively developed various ToB businesses related to Industrial Internet. With the rapid development of the ToB business, if the Company fails to adjust its business strategy to respond to changes in industry trends and market needs on a timely basis, to continuously enhance its organisational structure and suitability with professional talents, to improve its internal management system and processes for ToB businesses, to enhance its supply chain management capabilities, or to improve its collaboration mechanisms with various business partners, it may face more management challenges, and may affect the sustainable development of its ToB businesses and the realisation of the Company’s strategic goals.

The Company continues to accumulate and solidify its experience in the ToB business, actively follow up and analyse the development trends and changes in customer needs of different industries in both the domestic and foreign markets. The Company continues to expand its footprints in various industries including social services, cultural and tourism, industrial, agricultural, transportation, energy, retail, financial services, by leveraging technological innovations such as cloud computing and AI technologies to create the smart industry upgrade solutions, and to build a new, intelligent ecosystem that connects consumers and business enterprises. 

The Company continues to optimise the management of its resource allocation, organisational structure, human resources, management systems, business processes, internal control, etc., strengthen its product development, and improve the efficiency of external collaboration, to ensure the sustainable development of ToB business. Concurrently, through continuous technological innovation, the Company continues to enhance its ability to serve corporate clients and to promote the integrated development of both digital and real economies to create more value to the society.

#### 8. Business continuity risk

The stability of servers and network infrastructure for products and platforms of the Company is of vital importance for the sustainable operation of the Company’s business as well as the provision of high-quality user experience. Therefore, any material functional defect, interruption, breakdown or other issues in IT system functions are likely to adversely impact the Company’s businesses. In addition, the Company’s operations may be affected by uncontrollable external factors such as natural disasters, social security events, epidemic disease or energy supply. Relevant incidents may damage workplaces and equipment that are vital to the operations of the Company and its business partners, and threaten the health of their employees, which results in disruption of Company’s normal operation.

The Company continues to invest in its network infrastructure to enhance its established business recovery mechanism, to strengthen the stability of its domestic and international product services and business operations, to safeguard network security and to provide consistent support to business development. The Company has also established dedicated teams to develop contingency plans in relation to business continuity and perform regular drills. All business units also actively implement various emergency measures to ensure the smooth operation of business. In addition, the Company has established an independent dedicated team to perform regular checks on the effectiveness of the relevant emergency mechanisms and measures, and the performance of regular drills and its results.

#### 9. Social responsibility and environmental sustainability risk

International organisations, regulators and the capital markets have formed a consensus that ESG performance is an important standard to evaluate the non-financial performance of corporates. ESG performance will affect the valuation as determined by the shareholders and other stakeholders, which may lead to certain impacts for the Company.

The Company has established an ESG team to conduct a comprehensive evaluation, manage and enhance our ESG performance, and make annual disclosures in accordance with compliance requirements and international standards. Please refer to the “ESG Report” published by the Company for details.

The Company upholds its vision and mission of “Value for Users, Tech for Good”, and constantly reviews its products and platforms from the perspective of social responsibility and incorporated “Sustainable Innovations for Social Value” into its core strategy as part of its strategic upgrade in 2021.

#### 10. Fraud risk

In recent years, fraudulent activities have occurred frequently in the Internet and technology industry and therefore integrity has been an important concern. As the business continues to develop, and the form and complexity continues to evolve, it is inevitable that the Company faces a higher level of fraud risk. For example, fraudulent activities caused by collusion between suppliers/business partners and employees can have a negative impact on the reputation and financial position of the Company.

The Company always adheres to the value of integrity, has zero tolerance for fraud, and is determined to fight against any fraudulent activities. The Company has established effective internal control systems and is continuously improving them. These systems have been strengthened by systematic, transparent control measures and procedures.
